LP2C1 notes:
Filters 1 - 3 developed very quickly. There were well formed in the 1st 1000 iterations.
After 2000 itterations filter 4 is still not well formed and this is reflected in the 1st
FC weight matrix.  The 4th quadrant has distictly less character than other
quadrants of the matrix.
1 full epoch and filter 4 is still not forming.  The 1st FC matrix clearly shows that
no attention is being given to filter 4 results.
3 full epochs and filter 4 is just barely forming.  Test correct: 9360
5 full epochs and filter 4 is not forming.  Test correct: 9439
smooth
7 epocs.  Now filter 4 is clearly forming and the other filters are keeping their 
form.  Seems to indicate that filter 4 is orthoganal or at least indpendant of the
others.
27 epocs.  Test correct: 9544  Average of the training error is %96.6
47 epocs.  Test correct: 9704  Average of the training error is %97.8.  I thought
the model was starting to overfit but now it does not seem like that is so.
67 epocs.  Test correct: 9746  Average of the training error is %98.1.
87 epocs.  Test correct: 9719  Average of the training error is %98.2.  No progress.
107 epocs. Test correct: 9729  Average of the training error is %98.3.  No progress.

smooth with width of 3.  This was suficient to put some content in the Layer 4 weights where there were quiecnet rows.
2 epochs.  Test correct: 9463  Interestingly, the quiecent rows are reemerging in Layer 4 weights.

7 epocs. Test correct: 9786  Average of the training error is %96.9.  The flat rows in layer 4 remain.   Rows 5,6,7 and 15 are pretty darn flat.
